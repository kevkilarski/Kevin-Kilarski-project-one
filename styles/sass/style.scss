// Notes to the designer:
    // The font used for the 'Comments:' header on the Blog site was not able to be matched - it doesn't appear to be part of the fonts provided in the style guide and no other match could be found.  The 'Lato' font, used for most elements, was utlizied.  As well, the font size for the h1 heading on the home page was made responsive to accomodate for smaller viewports, which changes the determined pixel size provided in the style guide.

// Notes for marking:
    // 1. I converted the navigation bar into a 'hamburger menu' and made use of a strategy from a previous lecture I attended in the Juno Accelerated Web Development class.
    // 2. I tried to follow a BEM type of naming convention, using 'index-', 'blog-', and 'contact-' to denote when elements were targeted for these specific pages.  After speaking with some classmates, it seems like creating a wrapper around the HTML elements of one page could be better practice (e.g. wrapping the blog HTML in a div with class "blog", then targeting .blog in your SCSS).  Is the approach I'm describing a more common way to achieve the same result? I'm fairly green with multiple pages, so any feedback is really appreciated!
    // 3. I was conflicted on my feelings regarding where to place styling decisions that were not included in the style guide (e.g. the date of the 'Five days of ocean seas' post in the blog section).  I spoke with Owen about this and he suggested that placing this in the blog partial, as opposed to the typography partial, might make the most sense considering this is only being used on one page.  I did as such.  If this could be changed (maybe placing it at the top of the blog partial, before styling the header?), just let me know.
    // 4. I tried using a partial for global header properties, with adjustments to the header featured within the respective partial of a page.  I was going to do so with forms, but was unsure about this up to submission.  I like the efficiency, but would it be better served as a mixin?  And if it does work as it's own partial, is it placed in the style.scss as I have done?
    // 5. I could not seem to set the sunglasses image in the header as I would have liked... my apologies for any wonkiness!
    // 6. As always, the code could absolutely be drier.  Any tips would be really appreciated!
